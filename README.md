A solution to find the most costly solution inside a matrix being able to only go down or left/right.

The algorithm must deduce using an inference tree which solutions are the best ones. This is done checking all possibilities of movement and putting them inside the tree. After we find a possible solution we check how good it is. If it passed the minimum requirement we save it as a probable solution. After it is done the program show it's best trace through the matrix, having the maximum cost.
